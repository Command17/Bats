- Ever wanted to push your friend of a cliff without them escaping?
- Ever wanted to just get the creeper away from your house?
- ~Ever wanted to just launch the cow infront of you to space?~

**Well now you can!**

## How do they work and what do they do?

The bats work like a sword but have way more knockback than a sword.

**Three** of the total **11** bats also have special abilities which you can
find on the [wiki](https://github.com/Command17/Bats/wiki).

## Where can I find more information about the bats?

Just go to the [wiki](https://github.com/Command17/Bats/wiki)! It's easy, trust me.
